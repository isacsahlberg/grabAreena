# grabAreena (new-data-backend branch)

This branch is a **rewrite** of grabAreena to use the JSON schedule endpoint
instead of scraping HTML. It is a work in progress.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo and switch to this branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isacsahlberg/grabAreena.git
   cd grabAreena
   git checkout new-data-backend
